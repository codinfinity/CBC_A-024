Energy from the sun reaches the earth as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet (UV) rays.

â€¢ UVA: 320 to 400 nm â€“ causes aging, wrinkling, and skin elasticity loss.

â€¢ UVB: 280 to 320 nm â€“ higher risk of skin cancer.

â€¢ UVC: 100 to 280 nm â€“ absorbed by the atmosphere.

UVA increases UVB's damaging effects like cancer and cataracts.

Melanin in your skin tries to absorb UV rays. A suntan is the bodyâ€™s defense, but sunburn shows melanin was overwhelmed. 
Too much exposure is dangerous and preventive measures are key to avoiding harm.

More people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year in the U.S. than all other cancers combined.

The most preventable risk factor? UV exposure. Use sunscreen, stay in shade, and avoid tanning beds.

Chronic sun exposure causes premature aging:

â€¢ Actinic keratoses: rough, reddish spotsâ€”can lead to squamous cell carcinoma.

â€¢ Premature aging: thick, leathery, wrinkled skinâ€”can be avoided with sun protection.

Up to 90% of visible aging is caused by sun damage, not time.
